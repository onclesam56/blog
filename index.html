    <h2>Me, Maths, and Physics</h2>
    <p>I love physics and math. Some things that I like about these subjects are that they are very precise,
        <br>I like the fact that they are very challenging, and it's just overall very interresting.
        <br>The way I learn about these subjects are surprisingly not from school,
        <br>I learn most of it from YouTube channels like kurzgesagt, Veritasium, Mark Rober, StarTalk, and Cleo Abram.
        <br>I also learn from books like "Fysikk for Begynnere" or Physics for beginners.

        <br>high school and university. middle and high school i don't want to say because of privacy
        <br>reasons, but university I wanna go to a school called NTNU or Norwegian University of Science and
        <br>Technology so that would be NUST in english. There i want to study software engineering or physics.
