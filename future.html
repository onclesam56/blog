    <h1>My plans for the future</h1>
    <p>So you want to know more about my plans for the future? Well, here it is!
        <br>So after i hopefully get into NUST I have plans to work at a big tech company.
        <br>So like Google, Microsoft, Apple, etc. you get it, or i wan't to go a different route.</p>

    <br>

    <h2>The second path</h2>
    <p>This path nr.2 is a risky and possibly dangerous path. In this path i dont go too university and
        <br>rather take an apprenticeship or just work a 9 to 5 on the side i will do a bunch of side hustles
        <br>to make extra money and I will probably make the side hustles that work into buisnesses which in a perfect world grows
        <br>big. I have tried some side hustles before, but i always run into porblems like the first time i tried to make a clubb/community for 
        <br>young investors to learn and grow. I called it UIF or young investing community so YIC in english.
